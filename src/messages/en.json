          "virtual-dom": {
            "title": "Virtual DOM in React",
            "content": "## What is Virtual DOM?\n\n**Virtual DOM** is a programming concept where a \"virtual\" representation of the UI is kept in memory and synced with the \"real\" DOM by a library such as React.\n\n## Why Virtual DOM?\n\nDirect DOM manipulation is expensive. Virtual DOM allows React to:\n\n- **Batch updates** efficiently\n- **Minimize reflows and repaints**\n- **Optimize rendering** by comparing virtual trees\n- **Provide a simpler programming model**\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. React creates a **virtual representation** of the DOM in memory\n2. When state changes, React creates a **new virtual DOM tree**\n3. React **compares** (diffs) the new tree with the previous one\n4. React **updates only the changed nodes** in the real DOM\n\n## Example\n\n```tsx\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWhen `count` changes, React:\n1. Creates new virtual DOM\n2. Diffs with previous virtual DOM\n3. Updates only the `<p>` text node in real DOM\n\n> **Tip:** Virtual DOM is not faster than direct DOM manipulation, but it makes React's declarative programming model possible and optimizes updates efficiently."
